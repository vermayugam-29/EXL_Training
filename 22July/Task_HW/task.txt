Outlier Z-Score


Outlier Removal in Product Pricing

📝 Scenario:

You're working with a product sales dataset from an e-commerce company.
The Price column seems to have a few abnormally high values due to data
entry errors (like typing an extra 0).

🔧 Task:

- Detect outliers in the Price column using Z-score.
- Remove the rows containing these outliers.
- Print the shape of the dataset before and after cleaning.
- Plot boxplots to visualize the difference.

📌 Hint: Use scipy.stats.zscore() and filter using np.abs(zscore) > 3.
