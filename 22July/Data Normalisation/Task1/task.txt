Task: Apply Min-Max and Z-Score Standardization
 
Objective:
Help a retail company normalize sales data to prepare it for
 machine learning. You will apply Min-Max Scaling and Z-Score
  Standardization to numerical columns and observe the transformed values.
 
Instructions:
	1. Load the data using pandas.
	2. Identify numeric columns to scale:
		UnitsSold, UnitPrice, and TotalRevenue
	3. Apply:
		Min-Max Scaling using MinMaxScaler
		Z-Score Standardization using StandardScaler
	4. Add scaled results as new columns:
		UnitsSold_MinMax, UnitsSold_Zscore
		Same for the other 2 columns.
	5. Combine the results with the original DataFrame.
	6. Print the first 5 rows of the final DataFrame.
